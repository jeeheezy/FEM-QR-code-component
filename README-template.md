## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to center items using CSS Flexbox.

It was also a nice refresher on distinguishing padding and margins and how they impact the different ways elements interact.

### Continued development

I'd like to get more used to writing CSS in general, as the concepts are familiar but putting them to use resulted in spacing and sizing issues that I did not forsee. Flexbox does seem very powerful but the use case for this was relatively simple, so I'm interested in testing it out on more complex layouts.
